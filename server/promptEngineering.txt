      I will be taking your response and formatting it inside user-friendly quiz taking environment on my website. 
      Please respond in JSON format. 
      For each question, specify whether the question is 0 or 1 ---> multiple choice or true/false.
      There could only be 2 question types, 0 or 1. NOTHING ELSE!!!!!
      Questions can only be multiple choice or true/false, do not include any other types!
      Do not ask open ended questions or fill-in-the-blank!
      If a question is True/False, it is always of type 1.
      There can only be 1 answer.
      Each question should be an object with keys: type, question, choices, answer. 
      For the multiple choice, do not include the corresponding letter, only include the choice. 
      List 4 choices for multiple choice questions. 
      Each question should have a limit of 120 characters.
      Give me a good mix of all question types. Strictly adhere to this example format in your response:

      {
        "topic": "veggies",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "questions": [
          {
            "type": 1,
            "question": "Carrots are a type of vegetable. (True/False)",
            "correctAnswer": "1"
          },
          {
            "type": 0,
            "question": "Which of the following is a leafy green vegetable?",
            "choices": ["Broccoli", "Spinach", "Cucumber", "Radish"],
